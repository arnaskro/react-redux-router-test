# react-redux-router-test
I created this app to test out React, Redux and React Router while connecting them to external APIs.

[DEMO HERE](https://arnaskro.github.io/react-redux-router-test/)

# Pages
The app contains 3 pages:

| # | Page | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Landing page | `"/"` |
| 2 | Programmers page | `"/programmers"` |
| 3 | Users page | `"/users"` |

# Setup
First install the dependencies with `npm install` and to check out the application on `localhost:3000` run this command `npm run dev`. That is it!
